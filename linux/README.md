# 1.- Create symbolic link between this repo's aliases folder

```bash
./install.sh
```

# 2.- Add .aliases to your ${PATH}

TO DO
It is my wish to have every env variable automatically loaded when a file is created here.
the idea is for each CLI and tool to have a separate folder for easy management
it would be nice as well to have a "sensitive" folder section for API_KEYS and things of the sort
also, simple "aliases" should just go into the .aliases/aliases file
while other custom scripts should be into their own separate folders
